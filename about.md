Matt Loar brings seven years of professional software engineering experience
to the practice of law.

Graduating with a degree in Computer Science from the Grainger College of Engineering at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Matt joined Microsoft as a developer in the Windows
division working on XML Paper Specification (XPS) APIs, and was a co-inventor on the Load-Time
Memory Optimization patent
([US20130318435A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130318435A1/en)).

Matt later joined Amazon and worked on Prime Video before returning to the University of Illinois to
study law, where he graduated *magna cum laude* and was Executive Editor of the University of
Illinois Law Review.

Following a brief stint as a support employee in federal law enforcement, Matt began a seven-year
career as in-house counsel at CBRE, then F5, specializing in data protection and privacy law.
Starting his own firm in 2025, he now stands ready to put his extensive technical knowledge and
experience to work for you!
